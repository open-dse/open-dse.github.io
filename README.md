[Open DSE](https://open-dse.github.io) has born from the need of establishing and spreading good practices in Data Engineering, Machine Learning and Data Science Project Management. Aware that *good practice* is a vague concept, we are seeing that nowadays there is no clear established practice that can ensure a Data Science project to deliver the highest business value. By bringing together data practitioners in the Netherlands, Open-DSE aims at creating a network of professionals that openly share their knowledge in this field.

Open DSE wants to achieve its objective via **meetups, hackathons and courses**. Meetups are a peer-to-peer share. Professionals will gather together to share their knowledge via presentations and demos. The contents of the meetups will be made public and shared between the community members. Presentations are nice but having hands-on knowledge is even better! That why Open-DSE organises hackathons where the community practically applies the lessons learned during the meetups and enjoys doing something practical. The lessons learned during the meetups and hackathons will be also spread in form of courses for the community members.
