We are very happy and proud to open source an [introductory course on Apache Spark](https://github.com/open-dse/architect_big_data_solutions_with_spark) course with [Vladimir Osin]({{site.baseurl}}/author-vladimir-osin). This course has been taught in [Jheronimus Academy of Data Science](https://www.jads.nl/) for over two years now, but was tightly coupled to the university infrastructure. However, recently we switched everything over to Databricks, so the tutorials / labs can be executed on their community (free) edition. 

In this course we introduce Spark's core framework, and then dive into other modules like SparkSQL, Spark Streaming, and Spark ML. Why we do this? Because we both really love what we do, and we believe education is a right, not a privilege.
