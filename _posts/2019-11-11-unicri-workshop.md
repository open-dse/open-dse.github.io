    Open | DSE organized a practical part of the workshop about deepfakes detection and ai video manipulations. This workshop was brought to life by the joint effort of Open | DSE, <a href="https://datascienceinitiative.eu/">Data Science Initiative</a> and <a href="http://www.unicri.it/">United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute</a>. We had an amazing set of presentations from the NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency), Europol and Ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid. It was also useful to discuss how companies, like TomTom, are using artificial intelligence to improve the value of their products to the customers. Great shout out to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/author-pierluigi-casale">Pierluigi Casale</a> for the overall organization.

I hope it was useful and practitioners will utilize canvas in their daily work.
