[John Kop](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-kop-992a9233/) and [Luc Nies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucnies/) from Wärtsilä presented an overview of anomaly detection systems that they are using to prevent failures of ship engines. Another interesting aspect is valuable role of experts in the process of determining anomalies.

I discussed ways how you can start utilizing Docker for your data science tasks and why it's really important. We have some nice docker images already [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/opendse).
