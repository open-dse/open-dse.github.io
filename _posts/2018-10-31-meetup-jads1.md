Almost half a year ago together with [Ekhtiar Syed](), we decided that it will be relevant to organize a meetup for our educational initiative. Yesterday, the plan was executed at Jheronimus Academy of Data Science with help of our good friend [Damian Andrew Tamburri]().

It was a pleasure to see all of the attendees. We managed to attract a versatile audience (take a look at the attached EDA of the audience). The goal of our meetups is to connect with data scientists and engineers around this region. Since we already have a small network of our own, we can bootstrap this goal with this meetup.

[Ekhtiar Syed]({{site.baseurl}}/author-ekhtiar-syed) did a great kick off explaining our core values and intentions at [Open DSE]({{site.baseurl}}/welcome-to-open-dse), which is to gather data scientists and engineers and form a family-like community.

[Pierluigi Casale]({{site.baseurl}}/author-pierluigi-casale) did an inspiring talk of mobility transformation using AI/ML.
