It was a great pleasure to host a our second meetup at JADS. We managed to maintain a nice balance of audience.

As usual, [Damian Andrew Tamburri]({{site.baseurl}}/author-damian-andrew-tamburri) gathered us in such a nice place and gave a talk about research and education activities at Jheronimus Academy of Data Science.

[Julian Atkinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-atkinson-685907/) did a great talk about how you can build AI solutions at Google Cloud, especially using Big Quiery.

After the meetup, everyone digested the answer for "What is Kafka?" question, thanks to an amazing talk from [Ekhtiar Syed]({{site.baseurl}}/author-ekhtiar-syed) (p.s. in the big data world, Kafka is not a novelist, but a distributed stream processing platform).
